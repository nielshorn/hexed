 * 2.00.01:	This is an alpha release, intended to show the idea of what
		the final product should look like. Not all functions have
		been implemented yet and many things will change still, but
		feel free to take a test-drive and send your comments to me
		:-)
		This version has a maximum file-size limit of almost 4GB and
		add multi-level undo history (up to 1000 changes).

A word of caution
-----------------
This program gives you complete access to binary and executable files and 
should always be used with caution: executing modified executables can have
unpredictable results if you're not sure what you're doing.
Always make a back-up copy before modifying any file!

History
-------
nHex-Ed is loosely based on Hex-Ed for Windows (2), which itself was based on
earlier hex-editors written by me in C on MS-DOS, and even before that in
BASCOM on CP/M, so the origin of this program started a few decades ago...
The oldest sources I still have are from 2003 (version 1.00.00 of Hex-Ed for
Windows), so I'll keep that as the initial copyright year for nHex-Ed. :)

Versions
--------
Please check the included ChangeLog for the version history.

Feedback
--------
nHex-Ed is a work-in-progress and has room for several improvements, but for
this to happen I need your feedback with suggestions, complaints, bug-reports
etc.

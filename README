nHex-Ed
=======

nHex-Ed is a simple Hex Editor that uses the ncurses library.

It is loosely based on Hex-Ed for Windows (1), which was based on earlier
hex-editor written by me in C on CP/M and MS-DOS, so the origin of this
program started a few decades ago...

It is a work-in-progress and has several limitations, most importantly a
maximum file size of 16MB.
